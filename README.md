# 2020 Florida Healthplan Recommender

## Why Do we need a Healhplan Recommender?
As of today,  November 14, we are in the middle of the annual enrollment on Healthcare.gov.  With over 1 million total plans nationwide, it is difficult to find the right plan.

## Why Florida?
At over 1.7 million people signing up on Healthcare.gov from FLorida in 2019, they are by far the largest user of the service.  FLorida had more people use it last year than the bottom 25 states combined.  Furthermore, they are 300,000 users ahead of 2nd place California and almost 700,000 ahead of 3rd place Texas.

## What makes this one different?
The official web page cannot recommend plans, only show options. THis tool recommends plans based on the user's benefit needs. On top of that, it three other critical metrics left off the normal site. First, it shows the claim denial rate for 2019. Second, its shows how many people were disenrolled by October 1 who bought plans by January 1. Third, it provides user satisfaction ratings from 2019 on a 1-5. scale.
